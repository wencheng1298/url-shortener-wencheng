# A Simple URL Shorterning Service

This repository contains the client and server code for implementing a url shortening service. Through this program, users are able to enter a http/https url from the UI
and obtain a shortened url. The service is not hosted and hence users will need to run the server locally in order to use the services.
Backend server provides REST API services.

## Environments

### Languages and Frameworks ETC
- JavaScript
- ReactJS (Client)
- NodeJs (Server)

### Testing Scripts
A simple test script is written in server/tests/... folder. You can run the tests using the cmd "npm test"

## Getting started
1) Install the required node packages using "npm i"
2) Navigate into the server folder and run "node server" to start the backend server.
3) Navigate into the client folder and run "npm start" to start the client. A webpage will be created on your default browser.
